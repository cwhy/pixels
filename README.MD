## PIXELS

A list of tasks for machine discovery of logical patterns in 2D space.
All tasks are visual puzzles and have the same input:
a binary 19x19 matrix and a categorical output,
similar to MNIST.

The tasks are expected to be trivial for human,
either by eye-balling or create rules,
but difficult for machine learning to learn as distributions.


### List of tasks:

* Repeated Teris
* Nail on a wall
